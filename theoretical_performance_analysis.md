## 1. Theoretical Peak Compute Performance

### FP32 Floating-Point Operations

**Per-Core Throughput (FMA-only workloads):**
- 2 FMA units × 8 FP32/vector × 2 ops/FMA = 32 FLOP/cycle
- At 5.4 GHz boost: 32 × 5.4 = **172.8 GFLOPS per core**

**12-Core Total (all-core boost ~4.5 GHz typical):**
- 32 FLOP/cycle × 12 cores × 4.5 GHz = **1,728 GFLOPS = 1.73 TFLOPS**

### INT8 Operations (AVX2)

**AVX2 INT8 Throughput Analysis:**

Using AVX2 with 256-bit vectors:
- 256 bits / 8 bits = 32 INT8 values per vector

For our workload (dot products with multiply-accumulate):
- We use `VPMADDUBSW` (multiply pairs of INT8, add adjacent results to INT16)
- This processes 32 INT8 values → 16 INT16 products in one operation
- Throughput: 2 VPMADDUBSW per cycle (assuming 2 vector integer units)

**Per-Core INT8 Ops:**
- 2 ops/cycle × 32 INT8/op = 64 INT8 multiply-adds per cycle
- Counting multiply and add separately: 64 × 2 = **128 INT8-OPS per cycle**

**At 4.5 GHz all-core boost:**
- Per core: 128 ops × 4.5 GHz = **576 GOPS**
- 12 cores: 128 ops × 12 × 4.5 = **6,912 GOPS = 6.9 TOPS**

**Note:** This assumes perfect pipelining and no execution port conflicts. Real-world throughput may be lower (50-70% achievable).

## 2. Memory Bandwidth Requirements

### Model Architecture (EmbeddingGemma 300M Q8_0)

**Model Configuration:**
- Embedding dimension: 768
- Number of layers: 24
- Attention heads: 12 (head_dim = 64)
- KV heads: 4 (Grouped Query Attention)
- Intermediate dimension: 1,152
- Model size: ~300M parameters (~300 MB in Q8_0 format)

### Compute Intensity Analysis

**Forward Pass for Single Token (seq_len=1):**

Per layer operations:
1. **Attention block:**
   - Q projection: 768 × 768 = 589,824 INT8 ops
   - K projection: 768 × 256 = 196,608 INT8 ops
   - V projection: 768 × 256 = 196,608 INT8 ops
   - Attention output: 768 × 768 = 589,824 INT8 ops
   - Attention computation: ~768 FP32 ops (small for single token)
   - **Total: ~1.57M INT8 ops + ~0.77K FP32 ops**

2. **FFN block:**
   - Gate projection: 768 × 1,152 = 884,736 INT8 ops
   - Up projection: 768 × 1,152 = 884,736 INT8 ops
   - Down projection: 1,152 × 768 = 884,736 INT8 ops
   - **Total: ~2.65M INT8 ops**

**Per layer total: ~4.2M INT8 ops + minor FP32 overhead**

**Full model (24 layers):**
- 24 layers × 4.2M = **100.8M INT8 ops per token**
- Plus embedding lookup, norms, pooling: ~5M additional ops
- **Total: ~106M INT8 ops per forward pass (single token)**

### Average Sequence Length: 9 words ≈ 12 tokens

**Total compute: 106M × 12 = 1.27 billion INT8 ops**

### Memory Traffic Analysis

**Weights loaded per layer:**
- Attention matrices: (768×768 + 768×256 + 768×256 + 768×768) / 1024 = 2,640 KB
- FFN matrices: (768×1,152 + 768×1,152 + 1,152×768) / 1024 = 2,580 KB
- **Per layer: ~5.2 MB**
- **24 layers: ~125 MB**

**Plus:**
- Embedding table: ~200 MB (sparse access, ~12 KB for 12 tokens)
- Activations: ~2-3 MB per layer (reused)

**Effective data traffic (with L3 cache hits):**
- Cold run: ~300 MB (full model)
- Warm run: ~12 KB embeddings + ~5 MB activations = ~5 MB

**Arithmetic Intensity (warm):**
- Compute: 1.27 billion INT8 ops = 1.27 GOP
- Memory: 5 MB = 5 MB
- **Intensity: 1,270 / 5 = 254 ops/byte**

**Arithmetic Intensity (cold):**
- Compute: 1.27 GOP
- Memory: 300 MB
- **Intensity: 1,270 / 300 = 4.2 ops/byte**

## 3. Compute-Bound vs Memory-Bound Analysis

### Memory Bandwidth Ceiling

**Peak memory bandwidth: 83.2 GB/s**

For arithmetic intensity I (ops/byte), the performance ceiling is:
- **Compute-bound if: Peak GOPS / Memory BW < I**
- **Memory-bound if: Peak GOPS / Memory BW > I**

**Roofline threshold:**
- Peak INT8 GOPS: 6,912 GOPS (theoretical)
- Memory BW: 83.2 GB/s = 83,200 MB/s
- **Threshold intensity: 6,912 / 83.2 = 83 ops/byte**

**Our workload:**
- Cold run: 4.2 ops/byte < 83 → **Memory-bound**
- Warm run: 254 ops/byte > 83 → **Compute-bound**

**Conclusion:** After warmup (model in cache), we are **compute-bound**. First inference is memory-bound while loading weights from RAM.

## 4. llama.cpp Performance Comparison

### Observed Performance

**llama.cpp (from compare_actual.txt):**
- Short document (9 words): 6 ms
- Long document (49 words): 18 ms

**pure-go-llamas (from benchmark_comprehensive.txt):**
- Short document (9 words): 51.1 ms (P50)
- Long document (49 words): 304.3 ms (P50)

**Performance ratio:**
- Short: 51.1 / 6 = **8.5× slower**
- Long: 304.3 / 18 = **16.9× slower**

### llama.cpp Efficiency Analysis

**Effective throughput (short doc, 12 tokens):**
- Compute: 1.27 billion INT8 ops
- Time: 6 ms
- **Throughput: 1,270 / 0.006 = 211,667 MOPS = 212 GOPS**

**Efficiency vs theoretical peak:**
- Theoretical: 6,912 GOPS
- llama.cpp achieved: 212 GOPS
- **Efficiency: 212 / 6,912 = 3.1%**

**But wait - this assumes all cores active!**

**Single-core llama.cpp (likely scenario):**
- Single-core peak: 576 GOPS (at 4.5 GHz)
- llama.cpp achieved: 212 GOPS
- **Single-core efficiency: 212 / 576 = 36.8%**

This is much more realistic. llama.cpp achieves ~37% of theoretical single-core peak INT8 throughput.

### Why 36.8% and not 100%?

**Limiting factors:**
1. **Memory stalls:** Even with good cache locality, L1/L2 misses occur
2. **Instruction mix:** Not all ops are vectorized INT8 matmuls (norms, activations, etc.)
3. **Pipeline bubbles:** Branch mispredicts, dependency chains
4. **Execution port contention:** Vector ops compete for limited ports
5. **Clock frequency:** May not sustain full 4.5 GHz boost for entire workload
6. **AVX2 limitations:** Our current code uses AVX2, not AVX-512 (though Zen 4's AVX-512 is double-pumped anyway)

**Industry rule of thumb:** 30-50% of peak is excellent for real-world inference workloads.

## 5. Optimization Headroom Analysis

### Current Performance Gap

**pure-go-llamas vs llama.cpp:**
- Short doc: 8.5× slower
- Long doc: 16.9× slower

**pure-go-llamas effective throughput:**
- Short: 1,270 / 0.0511 = 24.9 GOPS
- Long (49 words ≈ 65 tokens): 6,890 / 0.304 = 22.7 GOPS

**Single-core efficiency:**
- 24.9 / 576 = **4.3%** of single-core peak
- llama.cpp: 36.8% of single-core peak
- **Gap: 36.8 / 4.3 = 8.6× efficiency difference**

### Where Is Time Being Spent?

**Hypotheses (requires profiling to confirm):**

1. **Scalar overhead:** Bounds checks, slice indexing, Go runtime overhead
2. **Suboptimal SIMD usage:** AVX2 intrinsics may not be fully optimized
3. **Memory access patterns:** Poor cache locality or unnecessary copies
4. **Parallelism overhead:** Context switching, goroutine scheduling
5. **Quantization overhead:** Q8_0 dequantization may be inefficient
6. **Compiler limitations:** Go compiler may not optimize as aggressively as C++ compilers

### Theoretical Optimization Potential

**If we match llama.cpp's 36.8% efficiency:**
- Target throughput: 576 × 0.368 = 212 GOPS
- Target latency (short doc): 1,270 / 212 = 6 ms
- **Current: 51.1 ms → Target: 6 ms → 8.5× improvement needed**

**This matches our observed gap exactly!** The 8.5× slowdown is entirely explained by lower computational efficiency.

## 7. Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **We are compute-bound (after warmup):** Our arithmetic intensity (254 ops/byte) far exceeds the roofline threshold (83 ops/byte), so memory bandwidth is not the bottleneck.

2. **llama.cpp is very efficient:** Achieving 37% of theoretical single-core peak INT8 throughput is excellent for real-world inference workloads. This leaves only ~2.7× headroom to theoretical maximum.

3. **We have 8.5× optimization headroom:** pure-go-llamas currently achieves only 4.3% efficiency vs llama.cpp's 36.8%. This is a computational efficiency gap, not an algorithmic one.

4. **The gap is entirely explainable:** The 8.5× latency difference matches the 8.6× efficiency difference, confirming the issue is execution efficiency, not workload characteristics.

### Optimization Priority

**To close the gap, focus on:**

1. **SIMD optimization:** Profile and optimize AVX2 kernels (matmul, dequantization)
2. **Memory access patterns:** Improve cache locality, reduce unnecessary copies
3. **Scalar overhead:** Minimize bounds checks, optimize hot loops
4. **Compiler optimization:** Explore Go 1.21+ PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization)
5. **Dequantization:** Batch or fuse Q8_0→FP32 conversion with matmul

**Do NOT focus on:**
- Parallelism (already optimal for batch workloads)
- Memory bandwidth (not the bottleneck)
- Algorithmic changes (correctness already validated)

### Realistic Target

**Near-term goal:** 4× improvement (51 ms → 13 ms)
- Still 2× slower than llama.cpp, but closing the gap
- Requires reaching ~16% efficiency (vs current 4.3%)
- Achievable through focused SIMD and cache optimizations

**Stretch goal:** Match llama.cpp (51 ms → 6 ms)
- Requires 8.5× improvement to 37% efficiency
- May be limited by Go compiler capabilities vs C++
- Worth pursuing, but may hit diminishing returns

**Ultimate ceiling:** 2.7× faster than llama.cpp (6 ms → 2.2 ms)
- Would require 100% theoretical peak utilization
- Practically impossible for real-world workloads
- Not a realistic target
