## Key Results at a Glance

### Performance: 1.34x Speedup
- Current: 4.338s/iteration (135.6ms/text)
- Optimized: 3.228s/iteration (100.9ms/text)
- **Winner: Optimized (34% faster)**

### Scheduler Overhead: 4% Reduction
- `runtime.findRunnable`: 436s â†’ 418s
- **Winner: Optimized (less scheduler thrash)**

### Goroutine Creations: 9,600x Reduction
- Current: ~7.68 million goroutines
- Optimized: ~800 goroutines
- **Winner: Optimized (massive reduction)**

### Memory Allocations: 1% Reduction
- Current: 7156.5 MB
- Optimized: 7086.5 MB
- **Winner: Optimized (slight improvement)**

## Recommendations

1. **Use coarse-grained parallelism for batch >= 8**
   - Set `DisableMatmulParallel=true`
   - 34% faster for batch=32
   
2. **Further optimization opportunities:**
   - INT8 quantization buffer reuse (57% of allocations)
   - Token caching (26% of allocations)
   - Attention kernel fusion (memory-bound)

## How to Explore

### Quick View
```bash
# Read the summary
cat QUICK_COMPARISON.md

# See top CPU consumers

### Interactive Analysis
```bash
# Web UI (most user-friendly)
go tool pprof -http=:8080 current/cpu.pprof
go tool pprof -http=:8081 optimized/cpu.pprof

# Command-line
go tool pprof -top current/cpu.pprof
go tool pprof -list=MatMul current/cpu.pprof
```

### Generate Flame Graphs
```bash
# Install graphviz if needed
brew install graphviz

# Generate SVG flame graphs
go tool pprof -svg current/cpu.pprof > current/flame.svg
go tool pprof -svg optimized/cpu.pprof > optimized/flame.svg
open current/flame.svg
```
